A basic E-commerce store built on top of Angular to practice folder structuring, SCSS, usage of interfaces, classess, forms and form validation, routing, and more.

# DEVELOPMENT DATA:
1. Time taken: 3 days.
2. CLIENT only. Products have been hardcoded into an array.
3. With this project I learnt that SERVICES are the way to go when it comes to replicating the useContext hook in React and accessing the information globally.
